# Zodimac
In our new age of internet supremacy, do we still know what is going on within our own network? Like, what machines are actually enjoying our company? Why is our printer not working again? Is there really symbiosis between our router and the smart robot cleaning our floors? 

This small python executable helps with lightening the mood, and to encourage you to look at all the devices present in your network (a bit of practical security practice). While also finding out how their current months cycle is in line with yours. Is there true enlightenment in your relationship. 

You can download the executable (I know I tried) or pull the codebase and run it within your own means. 
Zodimac will pull all machines in your local network, find out their unique genotype known as a MAC adress and return you a small overview of their current zodiac, their IP and the information that is present from the small pull.
