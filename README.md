# Zodimac
In our new age of internet supremacy, do we still know what is going on within our own network? Like, what machines are actually enjoying our company? Why is our printer not working again? Is there really symbiosis between our router and the smart robot cleaning our floors? 

This small python executable helps with lightening the mood, and to encourage you to look at all the devices present in your network (a bit of practical security practice). While also finding out how their current months cycle is in line with yours. Is there true enlightenment in your relationship. 

## How to run:
### Zodimac standalone
1. Go to the top left green "code" button and click on "download zip".
2. Unzip the file in your finder or file explorer
3. Open the "dist" map and double click on the zodimac file.
4. Go to your security & privacy settings to allow this application to run
5. It opens a terminal screen
6. It opens Zodimac as a little tkinter GUI
7. Enjoy
8. Research your network further!

All the names you'll see are names that are given to your devices themselves and do not specifically need to be OS specifice (for example, i've named my tv: samsung-annoyance. It will show that name instead of tv. so it is a bit dependable). So also if it doesn't return a name, or a weird string, go and check out your router data!

The idea is that you can use this information to go more into a deep dive yourself (like logging into your router and see what these devices are and maybe even blocking it). The first step would be to access your router (there should be a how to on the back of your router), but mostly happens if you go to 192.168.1.1 in your browser (where you normally type in google.com). From there on it is up to you. 

### Zodimac.py
This one is a bit more tricky, You can pull the repository of the script and run it from the terminal (using python3 Zodimac.py while in the map that you have downloaded it to). It will need to have a base python3.13 installation. 

## Final takeaways
This is a combination of an art project as well as a way of getting people to understand bettter what is happening on their network and encourage everybody to see if their network is secure and safe. 

Thank you all for the use and love.
